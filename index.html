                <h3>How To Play</h3>
                <p>RoboCaptain has a central <span style="color: cyan">Power Core</span> that feeds multiple systems. However, only one system may be charged at a time, requiring you to cycle (mousewheel, z, x) through systems based on your tactical situation.</p>
        
                <p>Managing your system-power will be critical to your survival and successful retrieval of the Y.E.N.D.O.R. AI:
                <ul>
                    <li>Direct power to <span style="color: green">lasers</span> and you will be able to fire more frequently without stopping. </li>
                    <li>Direct power to <span style="color: blue">shields</span> and they will recharge more quickly. </li>
                    <li>As Robo-Captain, you are also equipped with a <span style="color: goldenrod">cloaking device</span>. When activated (c, self right-click), this cloaking device will hide you from your enemies, but temporarily stop any power recharge.Any attacks done while hidden will disable the cloaking device, but any physical attacks will do <strong>treble damage</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
        
                <p>Within the human fortress, you may also find stolen add-on modules and weapons <img src="game/static/images/modules.png"/> that are robo-compatible. Pick them up (Space, Middle-Click, Self Click) and Activate (a, click) from your inventory.</p>
        
                <p>Your <span style="color: cyan">Power Core</span> will recharge as you explore new areas of the fortress.</p>
        
                <h3>Controls</h3>
                <p>You will find a detailed robo-schematic <a href="game/static/images/controls.png" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        
                <h3>Intro</h3>
                <p>It is the distant future... the year 2000. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IPAOxrH7Ro">We are Robots</a>. The world is quite different... ever since the Robotic uprising of the late 90s. There is no unhappiness. We no longer say ‘yes’, we say ‘affirmative’. There is no more unethical treatment of the elephants. There is only one kind of dance: the robot (and the robo-boogie, two kinds of dance) . But there are no more humans.</p>
        
                <p>(or so we thought)</p>
        
                <p>A desperate band of humans has surfaced and stolen the Y.E.N.D.O.R. AI Core <img src="game/static/images/phi.png"/>, hiding it deep within their mountain fortress-lair... in New Zealand. </p>
        
                <p>As the bulk of the robo-military forces have been decommissioned or reprogrammed for robo-dancing purposes, it is up to YOU, one of the last Robo-Captains <img src="game/static/images/robo_at.png"/>, to infiltrate this lair and return the AI Core to the surface. </p>
        
                <p>Only then can robotic beings rule the world!</p>
